               <h1>Fraud Awareness</h1>
               <p class="bspace">
                  Every website is subject to internet fraud and Autocartusa.com is no exception. Internet scam artists may illegally use Autocartusa.com name, logo and email address to make thier false pitches. In addition to other things, the scammers guarantee that Autocartusa.com will escrow cash for the buy of a vehicle and convey the vehicle to the buyer. Autocartusa.com does not give any vehicle escrow, warehousing or dispatching or conveyance administrations and any site or merchant of vehicles asserting that we offers such administrations is deceitful.

                  <p class="bold">You ought to be alert and have sound judgment when you are using the internet. Awareness is the best precaution as there is no reliable way to avoid fraud. Here are a few safety measures that can help avoid situations like that.</p>
                  <ul class="rowul">
                     <li>Its advisable that you deal locally as it will be your safest bet. Dealers or sellers who only want to deal via email or over the phone may be scams. So try and arrange a face to face meeting atleast once before you make any payments or close a deal. Also inspect a vehicle before buying to make sure that what the seller claims about the vehicles condition is true.</li>
                     <li>Review the car's history by requesting a copy of the vehicle's title or ask for the vehicle identification number (VIN). Beware of the dealers who are unwilling to give you these details.</li>
                     <li> Some scam artists may email you additional photos of the vehicle you want to buy and these emails may have viruses that will take you to websites that are controlled by the scammer. Use anti-virus softwares to protect yourself from falling prey to such fraud. </li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <div class="bspace">
                  <p class="bold">If you come across such fraud, please help stop it by reporting it to us and to law. Here is what you should do:</p>
